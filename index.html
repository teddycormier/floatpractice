            Hendricks was the newest edition to the family about 2 years ago. We got him from Ottowa, Canada. Hendricks is a flatcoated retriever. In this photo, he is about 3 months old.

            This is a photo of Hendricks when he was about 6-months-old. Due to the fact that he grew so fast, he was just starting to get more coordination with his legs.

            One of Hendrick's favorite activities is going on walks in the woods. Since he grew up in the woods and is used to running around, he needs a lot of exercise during the day to keep him calm. After a long day of being outside, as you can imagine, he falls right asleep.

            This photo was taken around Christmas time -- his first Christmas with us. He grabbed a bow from the wrapping paper and wanted to play with it. Little did he know, it made for a great photo. At this point in his life, he was about 1 years old.

            This photo shows Hendricks when he was just over one year old and almost fully-grown. He is sitting on our patio and enjoying the very nice day outside.

            Lastly, this photo is of Hendricks when he was singing me happy birthday through the phone during my first semester at college. He is almost 2 years old in this photo. Surprisingly, ever since he was little he always responded to music and would howl along with the song/tune.
